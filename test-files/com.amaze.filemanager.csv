Crash issue Just installed and tried. IT CRASHES everytime I try to rename a file. OS is jellybean on MT6589 chip  so I guess it should work fine. So uninstalling as of now.
Crashes  nice interface Looks good but crashes on create folder
I really like the app  but lately I've been having problems with file actions  after trying something (paste  delete  rename  etc.) It crashes out :(
FYI-Crashes when I click Movies bookmark On the side menu  I clicked on 'Movies' bookmark. The app crashed all of a sudden. I had no Movies folder that time.
Crash On Nexus 5 with 6.0.1 when I try to open as card folder the app crash.

Great !!!!! but crashes Nice job so far But saving the 5th star for when its a little more stable.
Just crashes Tried to delete file and it crashed. Tried to copy a file and it crashed. Though this would be good replacement for ESFile but it fails miserably.
Was using it but now just crashes Installed Amaze some months ago but now I can't use it. I go to open it and it always reports 'Amaze has stopped'. Using a Nexus 5
Constantly crashes I love that this is open source  but the fact that it crashes all the time is a real problem. I'll try on another device soon.
Its really great except... I am not able to delete files/folders.The app is crashing when I try to do so. Even after the latest update
Works well Had a problem with the previous update where the app would crash on open. The 10/6 update fixed the issue. Very quick response from the developer.
yeah! ... you fixed the crashing
As others are saying  it updated this morning and now crashes every time I open it. This is a great app! I use it all the time. PLEASE fix it ASAP!
Crashed
simple  fast and quick fast and simple file manager. does the job well without any bloatware. the SMB functionality needs more polish it crashes when i play remote video files
Crashes when i try to cut and then paste a file into another storage (phone Xperia V)
Crash Whenever I copy anything from internal to external storage  the app crashes. Please fix. Device: D6653 android 6.0.1
Crashing after the update New update is crashing whenever I try to move it copy!! Fix it please
Liked it a lot  but... On my Moto X Play running Cyanogenmod 14.1 crashes when trying to work on the SD card.
Buggy Multi pane is fixed. Now it force closes when you delete something
Great interface. no ads or intrusive content and/or useless features. _ However the app doesn't move files it just copies them around. And it can crash when given lage files to handle. Fix those issues and you'll get a full 5stars rating! _Û_ Wow Amaze great moves! Keep it up. I'm proud of you!
When I select a couple of pictures and I cut them and then paste in the SD card the app crashes im running Android 4.4.4
Reliably crashes when switching from another app
Looks great. It does crash every now and then though
When using the root explorer  it literally crashes my entire device.
When using the root explorer  it literally crashes my entire device. It also crashes when trying to change drawer image. Not stable on the MI5.
